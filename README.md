##   About

A Pomodoro web app created by Austin Choi for the CodÃ©dex JavaScript course final project using Angular and TypeScript

### Version information

#### 0.0.3

In this version I changed how tasks are displayed to make it look cleaner. Now there is a counter for how many pomodoros have passed for the current active task (The task at the top of the list). This will soon be updated so a user can set which task they want to be at the top of the list. 

I have also made a basic Express.js API that connects to a MongoDB Atlas server however it is not deployed yet. I will be adding user authentication before doing so that way users can have their own list of tasks.

Please refer to [todo](#todo) for a list of current issues I will be taking care of

##   How to use

To use this click on which timer you want to use
> Pomodoro
>
> Short Break
>
> Long Break

After that click on "Start"

You can pause a timer by clicking on "Pause"

If you want to reset a timer, first pause the timer then click on "Reset"

You can also add tasks you want to accomplish during the pomodoro session by clicking on the add new task button then filling out the form to add a task!

Tasks will update when the timer is complete!

##   Deployment and testing

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
